## üìå About the project

This dashboard allows users to manage a list of employees with features to:

The project was developed using React class components, focusing on:

- State management via `this.state`
- Handling events and methods inside classes

- Lifecycle methods (where applicable)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** This project uses class components; however, there are plans to refactor it into functional components with React Hooks as part of future learning and improvement.
